# Driving duty audit

10 Hz sampled controls held to next sample; line error interpolated within each interval. All percentages share post-start-line time to last recorded unfinished-car sample. Intervals over 0.25 s are excluded; no extrapolated finish tail. Context is controller state, not causal proof. Below-solo flag means braking at least 2 m/s below a non-braking matched solo at that road location. Traffic, lateral path and vehicle state can justify it. Samples cannot establish sub-frame control smoothness.
